the 
baker

a 
low 
iq

bakery 
must 
have 
one 
star 
my 
grandmother 
didn't 
give 
her 
life 
in 
a 
world 
war 
for 
the 
quality 
of 
this 
cake 
my 
mom 
said 
i 
wasn't 
allowed 
to 
write 
a 
review 
because 
of 
what 
i 
had 
to 
say

cake 
doesn't 
make 
me 
feel 
like 
the 
world 
is 
progressing

have 
diabetes

fruitcake

were 
carrots 
on

had 
way 
better

this 
is 
a 
great 
disappointment 
just 
like 
me 
according 
to 
my 
father 
boooooooooo 
i 
strip 
this 
cake 
of 
its 
title 
of 
cake 
it 
is 
a 
shame 
to 
all 
other 
cake 
i 
thought 
this 
cake 
was 
bad 
how 
is 
this 
bakery 
still 
in 
business 
where 
did 
this 
baker 
learn 
to 
cook 
this 
is 
my 
last 
will 
and 
testament 
i 
leave 
everything 
do 
the 
dog 
because 
my 
dog 
didn't 
tell 
me 
to 
come 
here 
this 
cake 
is 
just 
like 
mom 
used 
to 
make 
i 
always 
hated 
it 
this 
cake 
is 
so 
bad 
that 
it 
made 
me 
never 
want 
to 
eat 
cake 
again 
when 
you 
eat 
such 
a 
bad 
cake 
as 
this 
it 
really 
puts 
your 
life 
in 
perspective 
i 
took 
the 
hit 
for 
you 
guys 
so 
take 
my 
advice 
and 
avoid 
this 
cake 
if 
you 
have 
any 
happiness 
left 
in 
your 
life 
i 
would 
recommend 
avoiding 
this 
cake 
my 
tongue 
will 
never 
be 
the 
same 
after 
allowing 
that 
travesty 
of 
a 
cake 
to 
come 
in 
contact 
with 
it 
were 
there 
the 
option 
of 
going 
back 
in 
time 
to 
stop 
myself 
from 
eating 
the 
cake 
i 
would 
do 
it 
in 
a 
heartbeat 
his 
cake 
not 
only 
tasted 
bad 
but 
it 
also 
gave 
me 
food 
poisoning 
the 
cake 
at 
this 
shop 
should 
never 
have 
been 
madei 
swear 
these 
people 
have 
no 
idea 
what 
good 
cuisine 
is 
trust 
me 
i 
work 
at 
a 
four 
star 
restaurant 
the 
deserts 
here 
are 
way 
overpriced 
there's 
no 
way 
i'm 
paying 
that 
much 
for 
a 
pastry 
the 
eclairs 
were 
bad 
and 
so 
was 
the 
service 
i 
ordered 
a 
graduation 
cake 
and 
it 
looked 
nothing 
like 
the 
picture 
on 
the 
website 
each 
time 
i 
am 
forced 
to 
go 
here 
i 
die 
a 
little 
inside 
this 
place 
used 
to 
be 
really 
good 
but 
its 
quality 
has 
declined 
over 
the 
years 
they 
messed 
up 
my 
cake 
but 
refused 
to 
give 
a 
refund 
if 
you're 
reading 
this 
bob

be 
hearing 
from 
my 
lawyerthis

the 
worst 
dessert

have 
had 
in 
my 
entire 
life

feel 
like 
eating 
this 
piece 
if 
cake 
could 
kill 
me 
whenever 
i 
see 
a 
piece 
of 
cake 
it 
makes 
me 
want 
to 
cry 
perhaps 
i 
was 
wrong 
about 
this 
dessert 
being 
good 
the 
piece 
yesterday 
was 
not 
a 
good 
piece 
i 
like 
the 
inside 
pieces 
but 
they 
gave 
me 
an 
edge 
piece

with 
a 
bite 
already 
in 
it 
tried 
your 
cake 
and 
it 
was 
hard 
as 
a 
brick

looked 
ok 
but 
the 
taste 
was 
bad 
overrated

the 
cake 
is 
the 
most 
nasty 
thing 
in 
the 
world

was 
dry 
tasteless 
and 
nasty 
i 
just 
wanted 
to 
eat 
a 
delicious 
cake 
but 
was 
saddened 
by 
the 
pure 
disgust 
i 
felt 
on 
the 
first 
bite 
i 
can 
not 
recommend 
this 
cake 
it 
was 
horrible 
whoever 
baked 
this 
cake 
does 
not 
know 
how 
to 
cook 
a 
good 
cake 
how 
in 
the 
world 
did 
this 
cake 
make 
it 
onto 
bakery 
shelves 
it 
is 
terrible 
when 
i 
put 
this 
cake 
into 
my 
mouth 
i 
instantly 
gagged 
and 
spit 
it 
out 
do 
not 
ever 
try 
this 
cake 
it 
will 
make 
you 
want 
to 
gagthe 
cake 
was 
absolutely 
awful 
without 
a 
doubt 
i 
would 
choose 
anything 
over 
a 
cake 
another 
bite 
i 
felt 
i 
was 
on 
the 
verge 
of 
diabetes 
when 
i 
took 
the 
first 
bite 
of 
that 
cake 
there 
was 
absolutely 
too 
much 
sugar 
in 
that 
cake 
and 
it 
made 
me 
what 
to 
puke 
on 
a 
spongy 
texture 
i 
cannot 
stand 
cake 
even 
in 
the 
slightest 
cake 
will 
kill 
your 
dog 
if 
it 
is 
made 
of 
chocolate 
too 
much 
cake 
being 
a 
good 
thing 
is 
a 
lie 
too 
little 
is 
still 
too 
much 
it 
feels 
like 
cake 
hates 
me 
and 
honestly 
i 
hate 
it 
just 
as 
much 
the 
thought 
of 
that 
cake 
shop 
makes 
me 
sick 
their 
chocolate 
cake 
is 
awful 
and 
it 
tastes 
very 
cheap 
that 
is 
the 
lousiest 
excuse 
for 
a 
cake 
that 
i 
have 
ever 
seen 
the 
taste 
of 
their 
strawberry 
cake 
is 
unacceptable 
the 
cake 
shop 
in 
the 
mall 
has 
some 
atrocious 
cakes 
whatever 
flavor 
cake 
this 
is 
it 
is 
gross 
and 
very 
bad 
do 
not 
buy 
cake 
from 
the 
ice 
cream 
store 
their 
cake 
quality 
is 
very 
poorwhat 
in 
the 
world 
was 
wrong 
with 
that 
blasted 
carrot 
cake 
i 
have 
no 
idea 
why 
in 
the 
world 
anyone 
would 
ever 
want 
to 
eat 
a 
cake 
that 
tastes 
just 
like 
real 
carrots 
carrot 
cake 
really 
sucks 
i 
mean 
honestly 
who 
even 
likes 
carrots 
literally 
no 
one 
could 
ever 
enjoy 
the 
carrot 
taste 
in 
carrot 
cake 
if 
i 
had 
a 
dollar 
for 
every 
time 
i 
enjoyed 
the 
real 
carrot 
taste 
of 
carrot 
cake 
i'd 
have 
exactly 
dollars 
the 
other 
day 
i 
microwaved 
french 
fries 
two 
days 
after 
ordering 
them 
and 
that 
tasted 
better 
than 
this 
carrot 
cake 
who 
even 
likes 
carrots 
one 
man's 
carrot 
cake 
is 
another 
man's 
carrot 
trash 
how 
could 
someone 
make 
such 
a 
monstrosity 
of 
a 
cake 
the 
cake 
was 
an 
abomination 
where 
can 
i 
find 
the 
trashcan 
where 
this 
baked 
good 
belongs 
i 
think 
this 
cake 
is 
worse 
than 
the 
last 
one 
i 
ate 
the 
lovely 
person 
brought 
in 
a 
poorly 
made 
cake 
that 
cake 
caused 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
sadness 
after 
eating 
it 
i 
thought 
id 
be 
happy 
to 
eat 
this 
cake 
but 
it 
ended 
up 
making 
me 
feel 
sick 
because 
it 
was 
not 
good 
this 
cake 
is 
chocolate 
so 
therefore 
not 
good 
that 
cake 
was 
terrible 
what 
a 
sad 
excuse 
for 
a 
cake 
i 
have 
never 
had 
a 
cake 
that 
tasted 
that 
bad 
i 
hated 
every 
bite 
of 
cake 
the 
cake 
was 
awful 
and 
tasted 
like 
cardboard 
i 
never 
want 
to 
eat 
a 
cake 
like 
that 
again 
i 
disliked 
the 
cake 
that 
cake 
was 
nasty 
and
